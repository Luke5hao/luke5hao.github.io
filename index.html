    <p>My name is Luke! I’m originally from New Jersey. 
    I currently study Computer Science and Data Science at Cornell University.   
    </p>

    <p>I'm excited about the many applications of data and software – from 
    developing data models that explain consumer behavior, to building data-driven 
    apps that make tasks more efficient, I'm enthusiastic about leveraging technology 
    in large-scale and creative ways.</p>
